# Helios-x

Helios-x is a private architectural umbrella for autonomous systems. This repository defines:

- system architecture
- governance and safety boundaries  
- agent coordination workflows
- Argus (Autonomous CTO)

This repository does NOT:

- execute trades
- manage credentials
- control capital directly

Execution systems (e.g. Rogue-X) live in separate repositories and are governed by the rules defined here.

**If it is not committed here, it is not authoritative.**
