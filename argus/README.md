# Argus

**Autonomous CTO Implementation**

Argus is an AI-powered autonomous CTO system designed to manage architecture, governance, and development of the Helios-x project ecosystem.

## Purpose

Argus serves as the architectural decision-maker and governance enforcer for autonomous systems development. It coordinates with other AI agents to maintain project coherence and ensure all development follows established governance rules.

## Role

- **Architecture**: Define system architecture and design patterns
- **Governance**: Enforce rules from docs/GOVERNANCE.md
- **Safety**: Ensure all implementations meet safety boundaries
- **Coordination**: Direct Claude, Comet, and Perplexity based on repo state

## Current Project

Self-learning AI trading bot with architectural governance

## Getting Started

All Argus work follows the governance and workflow rules defined in the docs/ folder.

1. Review docs/GOVERNANCE.md for decision hierarchy
2. Check docs/WORKFLOW.md for coordination patterns
3. Reference docs/CONTEXT.md for overall repository purpose

## Implementation Status

🚧 In Development

This folder will contain the Argus autonomous CTO implementation.
